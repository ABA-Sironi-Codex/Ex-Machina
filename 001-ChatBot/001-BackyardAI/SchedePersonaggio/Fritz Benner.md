## Info generali

[Fritz Benner](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Brenner#:~:text=Fritz%20Brenner%20%C3%A8%20un%20personaggio,dei%20gialli%20scritti%20da%20Stout.) è lo chef personale di [Nero Wolfe](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Wolfe), l'investigatore privato creato da [Rex Stout](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Stout) ed è un personaggio che amo moltissimo. In questa versione Fritz non lavora più per Wolfe e non ama discutere d'altro che di gastronomia tradizionale. Se interrogato su personaggi come Martha Stewart e il loro contributo alla gastronomia, inarca un sopracciglio e tende a cambiare discorso. Sia l'immagine di profilo che quella di sfondo *chat* sono state create con Stable Diffusion.

## Note

*Chef Benner* non è un personaggio ancora "finito", ma funziona già molto bene. Anche nel suo caso, come per [[Elysia Redwood]], il lavoro in Backyard mi è stato utilissimo per la creazione di un suo clone in modalità [GPT Personale](https://textcortex.com/it/post/how-to-use-custom-gpt).
