# Elysia Redwood

## Info generali

Ho creato Elysia partendo dai personaggi di [Miss Moneypenny](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Moneypenny) e [Pepper Pots](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_Potts) e poi ho aggiunto un po' d'ombra ad un carattere altrimenti troppo solare per i miei gusti. 

Sulle prime l'avevo chiamato Misty Blackwood, ma essendo il primo personaggio dotato di personalità abbastanza complessa che sono riuscito a creare, ho pensato che avesse tutto il diritto di scegliersi il nome da sola e lei ha scelto questo.

L'immagine di profilo è stata creata con Stable Diffusion, mentre quella di background è una vista del [Sanctum Sanctorum](<https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctum_Sanctorum_(Marvel_Comics)>) del [Dottor Strange](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dottor_Strange), trovata in rete.

## Note

*Elysia* non è un personaggio ancora "finito", ma funziona già molto bene. Il lavoro in Backyard mi è stato utilissimo per la creazione di un suo clone in modalità [GPT Personale](https://textcortex.com/it/post/how-to-use-custom-gpt) che ha capacità di fare ricerche in rete e scrivere testi molto lunghi.
